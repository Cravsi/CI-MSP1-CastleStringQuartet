## Design

### Design Choice
This webpage has been designed to be visually interesting and impart upon the readers the information required for them to feel they know enough about the violin quartet as potential customers or fans.
<br>

### Colour Palette
The chosen colour palette was chosen to appear clean and modern with inspiration from the BMW i series of cars. All colours were felt to contrast well and compliment each other by including shades blue.
<br>
The three colours used are shown on the palette below.
<figure>
    <img src="docs/features/colour-pallette.png" alt="The website colour pallette">
    <figcaption>The colour pallette used for the website</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

### Fonts
The *Oswald* font was used for headings.
<br>
The *Open Sans* font was used for bodies of text as it is considered complimentary to *Oswald*.
<br>

### Structure
The website structure was kept simple for the ease of navigation. Upon landing on the website the user 
is first met with a nav-bar to easily traverse the website, a recognisable logo to help the users confirm they have found the correct site and a hero-image of the quartet who they want to know more about and may recognise from an event the user user may have attended. A common header and footer is used across the site to provide a consistent UI experience for the user.
<br>
The site is spread across three separate pages:
<br> - An extended home-page which includes a hero-image, samples of the band playing, what types of events the quartet plays at & information on the quartet's players.
<br> - A gallery page containing videos and images of the quartet.
<br> - A contact page to allow the user to quickly get in contact with the quartet.
<br>
