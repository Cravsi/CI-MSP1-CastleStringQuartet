## Design

### Design Choice
This webpage has been designed to be visually interesting and provide the readers the information required for them to feel they know enough about the violin quartet as fans or potential customers.
<br>

### Colour Palette
The chosen colour palette was appears clean and modern, with inspiration from the BMW i series of cars. All colours were felt to contrast well and compliment each other by including shades blue.
<br>
The three colours used are shown on the palette below.
<figure>
    <img src="docs/features/colour-pallette.png" alt="The website colour pallette">
    <figcaption>The colour palette used for the website</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

### Fonts
The *Oswald* font was used for headings.
<br>
The *Open Sans* font was used for bodies of text as it is considered complimentary to *Oswald*.
<br>

### Structure
The website structure was kept simple for the ease of navigation. Upon landing on the website the user 
is first met with a nav-bar to easily traverse the website, a recognisable logo to help the users confirm they have found the correct site and a hero-image of the quartet, who they may recognise from an event the user user may have attended. A common header and footer is used to provide navigation & media links to the user.
<br>
The site is spread across one page with multiple sections:

- An home section which includes a hero-image, a short descriptive blurb and a performance section.
- An about section which contains information on the events the quartet accommodates and information on wach of the players.
- A gallery section containing images of the quartet.
- A contact section to allow the user to quickly get in contact with the quartet.
<br>

### Wireframes
Initially the site was designed to include four pages. This was changed during the project to be a one-page layout, wireframes for mobile, tablet & browser layouts can be seen in "One-Page Layout". 
<details><summary> <b>One-Page Layout</b> </summary>
    <figure>

        <figcaption>A wireframe for the one-page layout on mobile, tablet & browser</figcaption>
    </figure>
</details>
<br>

The wireframes prior to the layout redesign have been included below.
